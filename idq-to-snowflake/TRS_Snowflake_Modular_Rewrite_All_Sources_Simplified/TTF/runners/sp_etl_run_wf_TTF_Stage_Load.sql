-- sp_etl_run_wf_TTF_Stage_Load  --  WORKFLOW RUNNER (app level)
--
-- Runs the Snowflake replacement for IDQ workflow wf_TTF_Stage_Load,
-- in the same order as the original run script, with the same dependencies:
--   * m_Tgt_C_S_TTF_Pty_Validation first (it maintains
--     STG_TTF_PTY_INACTIVE_STS / STG_TTF_PTY_INACTIVE_LOG, which every
--     later mapping reads to filter out inactive parties);
--   * m_Tgt_C_S_TTF_Pty second (it loads the party and role tables);
--   * m_Tgt_C_S_TTF_Pty_Rle_Alt_Id third;
--   * m_Tgt_C_S_TTF_Pty_Rle_Phn fourth.
--   The IDQ command task (touch <workflow>.ind) is left to the scheduler,
--   exactly as in the original run script.
--
-- HOW TO RUN IT
--   CALL sp_etl_run_wf_TTF_Stage_Load();
--   (A JOB_RUN_ID is generated and returned. Pass one explicitly only if
--   you want this workflow attempt recorded under a specific id.)
--
-- RESTARTING (mapping level only -- there is no step-level restart)
--   A restart is simply a new run: call the runner again with no run id
--   (or with a new one). Each mapping, at its start (step 5), drops any
--   work tables the previous run of that mapping left in the database,
--   then runs every step from scratch. Work tables are never dropped at
--   the end of a run, and no mapping is ever skipped because it
--   completed in an earlier run -- a new run re-runs every mapping.
--   Because the procedures are insert-only with unique-key guards, a
--   re-run inserts nothing twice; it does not undo what an earlier run
--   already published (see the User Guide).
--
-- WHY THE RUNNER PASSES EVERY ORIGINAL PARAMETER EXPLICITLY
--   Mapping procedures append P_JOB_RUN_ID AFTER their original
--   parameters, so the runner cannot call a mapping with only the run
--   id -- it would land in the wrong parameter. The runner therefore
--   passes the original defaults (taken from each procedure's header)
--   in full, every time, followed by the run id.
--
-- WHY THE RUNNER DOES NOT RETURN EACH MAPPING'S SUMMARY
--   In Snowflake scripting, a CALL's return value cannot be assigned to
--   a variable as an expression, so the runner cannot collect the
--   mappings' summary strings. It returns the JOB_RUN_ID and a short
--   status line instead; the full per-step story is in the job-control
--   table (query VW_ETL_JOB_STORY for the run id).
--   Standalone mapping CALLs DO return their summary -- use those when
--   you run one mapping by hand.
--
-- This runner is APP level in the boundary model (see the User Guide):
-- it owns the workflow order, but it never writes to a target table
-- itself and never drops a work table.
--
-- INSTALL: schema TTF_ETL_WRK in database MDM_ETL_TTF (all names
-- unqualified, as in the mapping procedures).
